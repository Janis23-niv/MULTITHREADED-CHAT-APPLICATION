ðŸ“¡ Task 3: Client-Server Chat Application

This task involves building a **multithreaded client-server chat application** using Java Sockets. The system includes:

- A `Server.java` program that listens for multiple client connections and broadcasts messages to all connected users.
- A `Client.java` program that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.

Each client is handled on a separate thread, showcasing how Java can be used to manage concurrency in a networked application. This task simulates real-world chat systems and demonstrates how to maintain active communication between multiple users.
